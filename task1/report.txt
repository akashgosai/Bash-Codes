Problems faced:
1)Permission denied to open and view asgn directory. Used chmod 777 to gain access.
2)Permission denied to open the link run_me. Used chmod 777 to gain access.
3)No 'output' directory exists in asgn. Created one so that the link can execute the executable run_me hidden inside bin folder.

Commands used:
> To gain access to asgn directory: chmod 777 asgn
>To gain access to run_me link: chmod 777 run_me
>To make output directory: mkdir output
